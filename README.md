# AI-Sudoku
Sudoku game with AI solving puzzles and racing along as you solve puzzles.

I got this idea from a project I did in my Artificial Intelligence class which was to create AI that could solve any puzzle that was solvable. I decided that it would be a fun idea to add some extra features to this project and program it in C++ as it would be a good way to learn the language. Below you can find the original and new features added into this project.

ORIGINAL FEATURES

- AI that solves puzzles
- User inputs puzzles they want to solve
- Displayed in command line

NEW FEATURES

- User friendly GUI (In progress)
- Race against AI with different types of difficulty (Coming)
- Step by step AI solutions (Coming)
- Different puzzle levels of varying difficulty (Coming)
